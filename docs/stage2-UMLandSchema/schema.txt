Relationships

Tracking(TrackingId:INT [PK], trackedBy:INT [FK to Users.UserId], trackedUnit:INT [FK to Units.UnitId], startDate:DATE NOT NULL, endDate:DATE, accepted:BOOL)


Assumptions

Users should only create Ratings for buildings with units that they had previously been accepted to.

Users can create as many ratings as they want for 1 building, but only the most recent is considered when calculating the average ratings.

Units aren't the rooms themselves, but the offers for them. Two different units might refer to the same physical lodging, but this would only happen for different times, like leasing for fall of 2022 or fall of 2023.

Units will be placed within Buildings. This is because it is possible for many rooms to be in a single building. By having rooms be related to the buildings, ratings can be connected to buildings themselves and addresses don’t have to be repeated.

I don’t think having a rating for individual rooms would let a big enough sample size form for any year due to how buildings can change. Ratings will be created by Users and will require that the Users have been accepted to a Unit that is located in the Building being rated. Users should be able to call these Ratings into a list and average the values. 

Tracking is a relationship that will loosely keep track of communication between the lessor and lessee. Each tracking entry is considered open while the endDate is Null. Upon conclusion of the communication, an endDate will be defined and the accepted boolean will be defined as true or false depending on if the lessor and lessee have both accepted the terms of the lease.
